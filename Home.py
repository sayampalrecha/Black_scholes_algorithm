    ### Historical Background

    The Black-Scholes model was developed by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton
    in 1973. Their groundbreaking work:
    - Solved a fundamental problem in options pricing
    - Introduced mathematical rigor to financial economics
    - Led to the 1997 Nobel Prize in Economics (awarded to Scholes and Merton)

    The model continues to influence how we think about risk, pricing, and financial markets.
